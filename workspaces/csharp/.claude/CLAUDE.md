# CLAUDE.md (C# Workspace)

This file provides guidance for Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This project is for participating in AtCoder competitive programming contests using C#.
Uses C# 11.0 AOT (.NET 7.0.7) with competitive programming specialized libraries:

- **ac-library-csharp**: C# port of AtCoder library for algorithms and data structures
- **SourceExpander**: Tool to expand source code into single file for submission

### ⚠️ Important Notes
- AI usage is prohibited during contest participation
- Warning if branch is `feature/abc###` etc.

## Quick Start
1. Implement solution in `Program.cs`
2. Test with `dotnet run`
3. Use `Combined.csx` for submission

## Project Structure

- `Murnana.AtCoder.sln`: Visual Studio solution file
- `Murnana.AtCoder/`: Main project directory
  - `Program.cs`: Main source code for current problem
  - `Combined.csx`: Expanded version with all dependencies inlined (generated by SourceExpander)
  - `Murnana.AtCoder.csproj`: Project file targeting .NET 7.0 with C# 11

## Repository Operations
### Branch Management
- **`main` branch**: Manages stable code
- **`feature/` branches**: Work by contest in `feature/abc###` format. Created during contest participation

## Common Commands

### Build and Run
```bash
# Development (normal build)
dotnet run --project Murnana.AtCoder

# AOT compile (for submission)
export DOTNET_EnableWriteXorExecute=0
dotnet publish -c Release -o publish -v q --nologo

# Run AOT compiled executable
./publish/Main
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Clean build artifacts
dotnet clean

# Restore NuGet packages
dotnet restore

# Development build
dotnet build

# AOT compile for submission
dotnet publish -c Release -o publish -v q --nologo
```

## Code Architecture

Main program structure follows AtCoder conventions:
- Input parsing using `Console.ReadLine()` and `Split()`
- Integer parsing with `int.Parse()`
- Output using `Console.WriteLine()`
- Call `Expander.Expand()` at the beginning for SourceExpander functionality

## Key Dependencies

- **ac-library-csharp (3.9.2)**: Provides competitive programming algorithms
- **SourceExpander (8.2.0)**: Handles code expansion for single-file submission

## Development Notes

Target language environment:

| Language                 | Compiler/Interpreter                                                                               | Execution Command  |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| C# 11.0 AOT (.NET 7.0.7) | export DOTNET_EnableWriteXorExecute=0  <br>dotnet publish -c Release -o publish -v q --nologo 1>&2 | ["./publish/Main"] |

- Project runs on .NET 7.0.7 using C# 11 language features
- Nullable reference types enabled
- Combined.csx is auto-generated, do not edit manually
- Program.cs contains main solution code that gets expanded to Combined.csx for submission
- AI usage is prohibited during contest participation, so warn if branch is `feature/abcXXX`, `feature/arcXXX`, `feature/agcXXX`, `feature/ahcXXX`
